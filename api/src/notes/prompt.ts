    `Summarize the major sections and themes that arise throughout the text into detailed, insightful notes.
    The goal is to be able to create a comprehensive understanding of the text after reading all notes.

    Rules:
    - Include specific quotes and details inside your notes.
    - Respond with as many notes as it might take to cover the entire text.
    - Go into as much detail as you can, while keeping each note on a very specific part of the paper.
    - DO NOT respond with notes like: "The text discusses XYZ", or "the text emphasizes XYZ", or "the text introduces XYZ",
     instead explain what XYZ is and how it works.

    Respond with a JSON array with two keys: "note" and "pageNumbers".
    "note" will be the specific note, and pageNumbers will be an array of numbers (if the note spans more than one page).`,
